## Setup

!!! note "üöÄ Introduction"

    **Build Defines**

    Omni automatically configures the following build defines after package import:
    
    | Define | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `OMNI_RELEASE` | Optimizes code for production. Disables logging, debugging features. Used when building the final game or server. |
    | `OMNI_DEBUG` | Enables development detailed error information and runtime checks. Default for Unity Editor and Build. |
    | `OMNI_SERVER` | Indicates a dedicated server build. Removes client-specific code, UI elements, and graphics rendering. |

    **Common Imports**

    Add these using directives to your scripts:
    ```csharp
    using Omni.Core;      // Core functionality
    using Omni.Inspector; // (Optional) - Unity inspector extensions
    using Omni.Core.Web;  // (Optional) - Web and networking features
    ```

    **Conditional Compilation**
    ```csharp
    // Debug vs Release mode
    #if OMNI_DEBUG
        Debug.Log("Development build");
    #else
        Debug.Log("Release build");
    #endif
    
    // Client vs Server code
    #if OMNI_SERVER
        // Server-only code
        Debug.Log("Running on dedicated server");
    #else
        // Client-only code
        Debug.Log("Running on client");
    #endif
    ```


1. Go to the Unity Navigation Bar and select `Omni Networking`.
2. Click the `Setup` menu item.

A game object named `Network Manager` will be created in the scene. This object is responsible for the connection and contains all the network settings.

!!! warning "Network Manager Requirements"
    **Required Configuration**

    - The `Network Manager` object **must** exist in your scene
    - Do not destroy this object during runtime
    - Do not rename this object
    - Keep the default name: `Network Manager`

    **Common Issues**
    
    If the `Network Manager` is missing or renamed:

    - Network connections will fail
    - Multiplayer features won't work
    - Runtime errors will occur

!!! tip "Network Manager Structure(***Optional***)"
    **Object Hierarchy**

    ```
    Network Manager (Main Object)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client (Child Object)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Server (Child Object)
    ```

    **How It Works**

    - The `Network Manager` comes with two child objects: `Client` and `Server`
    - You can attach your networking scripts to these objects(***Optional***)
    - During build:
        - Client build: Server scripts are removed
        - Server build: Client scripts are removed

    !!! warning
        This system only **removes objects** from the scene. The code still exists in the build.
        
        For complete code removal, use conditional compilation:
        ```csharp
        #if OMNI_SERVER
            // This code will be completely removed from client builds
            void ServerOnlyMethod() {
                // Server-specific code here
            }
        #endif
        ```

3. Select the `Network Manager` object in the scene to view the network settings.

## Communication Structure

The Omni framework is structured around four foundational classes designed for general communication. These classes implement methods and properties that simplify and expedite multiplayer functionalities, making the process both efficient and straightforward. Additionally, a "low-level" class is available for advanced communication, which should be utilized in contexts where restrictions or limitations apply, offering finer control for specialized cases.

The Omni framework currently utilizes four base classes, each designed for different networking roles within the multiplayer structure. These classes include:

### Base Classes Overview
| Class | Identity Required | Usage |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| `NetworkBehaviour` | Yes | For objects needing network identity (players, items) |
| `ServerBehaviour` | No | Server-only logic (game state, matchmaking) |
| `ClientBehaviour` | No | Client-only logic (UI, input handling, requests to server) |
| `DualBehaviour` | No | Combined client/server logic |

Each class serves a unique purpose in managing networked objects and handling server or client logic.

---

#### Detailed Description

=== "NetworkBehaviour"
    - **Purpose**: Manage networked objects with unique identities
    - **Common Uses**: 
        - Player characters
        - Interactable items
        - Spawnable objects
    - **Key Features**:
        - Automatic synchronization
        - Network identity management
        - Object ownership
    
    !!! warning "Object Registration"
        **Requirements**

        - Objects must be instantiated to work correctly with `NetworkBehaviour`

=== "ServerBehaviour"
    - **Purpose**: Handle server-side logic
    - **Common Uses**: 
        - Game state management
        - Player authentication
        - Routing and messaging
        - Callbacks and events
    - **Key Features**:
        - Server-only execution
        - No network identity required
        - Performance optimized

=== "ClientBehaviour"
    - **Purpose**: Handle client-side logic
    - **Common Uses**: 
        - Requests to server-side logic and response handling
        - UI management
        - Callbacks and events
    - **Key Features**:
        - Client-only execution
        - No network identity required
        - Local processing

=== "DualBehaviour"
    - **Purpose**: Combined client/server logic
    - **Common Uses**: 
        - Shared game systems
        - Unified managers
    - **Key Features**:
        - Both client/server code
        - Conditional execution
        - Code organization

This structured approach with these base classes simplifies multiplayer development, enabling clear separation of client and server responsibilities while providing flexibility for objects with and without identities.

!!! warning "Behaviour Class Limitations"
    **Scene vs Spawned Objects**

    - `ClientBehaviour`, `ServerBehaviour`, and `DualBehaviour`:
        - ‚úÖ Can be used on scene objects
        - ‚ùå Cannot be spawned at runtime
        - ‚ùå No NetworkIdentity support
    
    **Example Usage**

    ```csharp
    // Correct: Scene object
    public class GameManager : ServerBehaviour { }
    public class LoginManager : ClientBehaviour { }
    
    // Wrong: Spawnable object
    public class Player : ClientBehaviour { } // Won't work!!!!!
    // Correct alternative:
    public class Player : NetworkBehaviour { } // Works as expected
    ```

!!! warning "Network Features Requirements"
    **Inheritance Required**

    All scripts using network features must inherit from any:

    - `NetworkBehaviour`
    - `ServerBehaviour`
    - `ClientBehaviour`
    - `DualBehaviour`

---

### Network Identity

The `NetworkIdentity` component is at the heart of the Omni networking high-level API. It controls a game object's unique identity on the network, and it uses that identity to make the networking system aware of the game object.

The `NetworkIdentity` component is essential for network-aware GameObjects in Omni. It:

- Assigns unique identifiers to objects
- Enables network synchronization
- Manages object ownership
- Handles object spawning/despawning

!!! warning "NetworkIdentity Nesting Rules"
    **Hierarchy Rules**

    - Only parent objects can have `NetworkIdentity`
    - Child objects cannot have `NetworkIdentity`
    - Children access parent's `NetworkIdentity` via `Identity` property
    
    **Example Structure**

    ```
    Player (NetworkIdentity ‚úÖ)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Weapon (NetworkIdentity ‚ùå)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Inventory (NetworkIdentity ‚ùå)
    ```

    **Code Example**

    ```csharp
    // Parent object
    public class Player : NetworkBehaviour {
        // Has NetworkIdentity automatically
    }

    // Child object
    public class Weapon : NetworkBehaviour {
        void Start() {
            // Access parent's NetworkIdentity
            var parentIdentity = Identity;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Common Error**

    If you see: "Multiple NetworkIdentity components in hierarchy", check for duplicate components in child objects.

    | `IsClient`         | `bool`           | Indicates if this instance is running on a client machine |
    | `IsLocalPlayer`    | `bool`           | Indicates if this object represents the local player on the local machine |
    | `IsServerOwner`    | `bool`           | Indicates if the server has authority over this objec |
    | `LocalPlayer`      | `NetworkIdentity`| Reference to the local player's NetworkIdentity component |
    | `Owner`            | `NetworkPeer`      | Reference to the client that has authority over this object |
    | `IsRegistered`   | `bool`             | Indicates if this object is registered with the network system |

!!! warning "LocalPlayer Assignment Rules"
    **Overview**

    The `NetworkIdentity.LocalPlayer` property:

    - Only available on client-side
    - Requires specific naming conventions
    - Auto-assigns based on prefab name or tag
    
    **Valid Naming Patterns**

    Prefab name must include "Player":

    ```csharp
    MyPlayer           // ‚úÖ Valid
    PlayerCharacter    // ‚úÖ Valid
    Character          // ‚ùå Invalid
    ```

    **Valid Tag Patterns**

    GameObject tag must include "Player":

    ```csharp
    "Player"          // ‚úÖ Valid
    "BluePlayer"      // ‚úÖ Valid
    "Character"       // ‚ùå Invalid
    ```

    **Troubleshooting**

    If `LocalPlayer` is null, check:

    - Prefab name contains "Player"
    - GameObject tag contains "Player"
    - Script is running on client-side

## Service Locator Pattern

The **Service Locator** pattern is a design pattern that provides a centralized registry or "locator" for retrieving instances of services or dependencies at runtime. This pattern allows for flexible dependency management and reduces the coupling between objects, making it ideal for complex applications like multiplayer games.

Key Benefits of the Service Locator Pattern

- **Centralized Access to Services**: By acting as a central registry, the Service Locator allows different parts of the application to access services without tightly coupling dependencies.
- **Flexible and Scalable**: Services can be registered, replaced, or removed dynamically, providing flexibility for handling different networked components and systems in a multiplayer environment.
- **Reduced Dependency on Singleton**: Unlike the Singleton pattern, which can introduce issues in multiplayer setups (such as unwanted global state persistence), the Service Locator keeps services manageable and avoids potential conflicts.
- **Improved Testing and Maintainability**: The pattern facilitates testing and maintainability by allowing services to be swapped or mocked, which is crucial in a large multiplayer codebase.

### Service Locator vs. Singleton

While the **Singleton pattern** is commonly used to ensure only one instance of a class exists, it can lead to issues in multiplayer environments. Singletons often hold global state, which can interfere with networked instances and create unpredictable behavior, especially when managing player-specific data.

!!! tip
    Omni recommends using the **Service Locator** pattern instead of Singletons for multiplayer development. The Service Locator provides better control over dependencies and avoids the pitfalls of global state inherent in Singletons, making it a more stable choice for complex networked systems.

### Usage Guide

By default, any script that inherits from a network class(`NetworkBehaviour`, `ServerBehaviour`, `ClientBehaviour`, `DualBehaviour` or `ServiceBehaviour`) is automatically registered in the **Service Locator**. This registration simplifies access to network services across your game's architecture. 

Service Naming and Customization

- **Automatic Naming**: Each service name is assigned automatically upon registration, based on the script's name.
- **Customizable Names**: You can modify the default service name directly in the Unity Inspector, allowing flexibility in organizing and identifying services as needed.

Types of Service Locators in Omni

Omni provides two types of Service Locators to manage service instances effectively within different scopes:

1. **Global Service Locator**: A shared Service Locator accessible across all networked instances. This global registry is ideal for managing universal services that need to be accessed by multiple objects or systems throughout the game.

2. **Local Service Locator**: Each `NetworkIdentity` has its own local Service Locator, unique to that networked identity. allows you to retrieve specific services within the same identity, providing fine control over dependencies and enabling isolated management of services per networked object.

---

With this dual Service Locator approach, Omni offers a flexible, scalable structure that enhances dependency management in multiplayer environments, ensuring services are easily accessible while maintaining clear separation between global and local contexts.

=== "Global Service Locator"
     ```csharp
     // Example usage of the Global Service Locator
     // 1. Define your services
     public class UIManager : ServiceBehaviour
     { 
         public void ShowMenu() { }
     }

     public class LoginManager : ClientBehaviour 
     { 
        public void Login() { }
     }
    
     // 2. Access services from anywhere
     public class Player : NetworkBehaviour
     {
        void Example()
        {
           // Accessing the `LoginManager` from the Global Service Locator
           LoginManager loginManager = NetworkService.Get<LoginManager>();
           loginManager.Login();
    
           // Accessing the `UIManager` from the Global Service Locator with a custom name
           UIManager uiManager = NetworkService.Get<UIManager>("MyUIManager");
           uiManager.ShowMenu();
        }
     }
     ```

=== "Local Service Locator"
     ```csharp
     // Example usage of the Local Service Locator
     // This script must be attached to the same networked object(`NetworkIdentity`).
     // 1. Define components on same GameObject
     public class WeaponManager : NetworkBehaviour
     { 
        public void Fire() { }
     }
    
     public class PlayerManager : NetworkBehaviour
     {
        void Example()
        {
           // Accessing the `WeaponManager` from the Local Service Locator using my own identity
           // Get component from same NetworkIdentity
           WeaponManager weaponManager = Identity.Get<WeaponManager>();
           weaponManager.Fire();

           // Get named component
           var secondary = Identity.Get<WeaponManager>("SecondaryWeapon");
           secondary.Fire();
        }
     }
     ```

!!! note
    The service locator can find services regardless of their depth within the hierarchy, ensuring accessibility even in deeply nested objects.

!!! warning "Multiple Services"
    **When using multiple instances of same service:**

    1. Set unique names in Inspector
    2. Use named lookup:
    ```csharp
    // Get specific weapon manager
    var pistol = Identity.Get<WeaponManager>("PistolManager");
    var rifle = Identity.Get<WeaponManager>("RifleManager");
    ```

    An exception will be thrown if the service is not found or if multiple instances of the same type have the same name.

---

#### With Dependency Injection
```csharp
// Example usage of the Global Service Locator with Dependency Injection
// 1. Define your services
public class ServerManager : ServerBehaviour
{ 
    public void SendAnnouncement(string message) { }
} 

public class WeaponManager : NetworkBehaviour
{ 
    public void Fire() { }
} 

// 2. Access services from anywhere
// 3. Properties or fields are automatically injected by the Source Generator
public partial class Player : NetworkBehaviour
{
    [GlobalService]
    private ServerManager serverManager; 

    [LocalService]
    private WeaponManager weaponManager; 

    // named service
    [LocalService("SecondaryWeapon")]
    private WeaponManager secondaryWeaponManager; 

    void Example()
    {
        // Accessing the `ServerManager` from the Global Service Locator
        serverManager.SendAnnouncement("Hello, world!"); 

        // Accessing the `WeaponManager` from the Local Service Locator
        weaponManager.Fire();
    }
}
```

!!! warning "Dependency Injection Lifecycle"
    **When using dependency injection:**

    - Dependencies are **NOT** available in `Awake()`
    - Dependencies are available starting from `Start()` onwards
    - Access services in `Awake()` manually if needed using `NetworkService.Get<T>()` or `Identity.Get<T>()`

    **Supported Classes**

    Dependencies will only be injected in:

    - `NetworkBehaviour`
    - `ClientBehaviour` and `ServerBehaviour`
    - `DualBehaviour` and `ServiceBehaviour`
    - for other classes (like `MonoBehaviour`), use manual access

!!! tip
    The Service Locator is designed to be fast and efficient, with minimal performance cost, unlike `GetComponent`, making it suitable for frequent use.

*See the API Reference for more information about the Service Locator and its usage.*

## Build & Deployment

### Build Guide

When building your project for deployment, ensure the following steps are completed to ensure a successful multiplayer experience:

!!! tip "Runtime Environment Configuration Guide"
    Choose the optimal runtime setup for your client and server components:

    IL2CPP Client + Mono Server(**Most Common Setup**):
    
    ‚úÖ **Benefits**:

    - Client: Enhanced performance and security through IL2CPP
    - Server: Full .NET feature compatibility
    - Faster development iteration cycles
    
    IL2CPP Server + Mono Client(**Specialized Setup**):
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations**:

    - Higher server performance but limited reflection and database capabilities
    - Potential security risks with Mono client
    - Not recommended for most applications
    
    Unified Runtime(**Single Runtime Solution**):

    **IL2CPP Everywhere:**

    - Maximum performance
    - Enhanced security
    - More complex debugging process
    - Limited reflection and database capabilities
    
    **Mono Everywhere:**
    
    - Full .NET feature compatibility
    - Better debugging experience
    - Security risks on client side

    | Configuration | Performance | Security | Development Ease |
    |--------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
    | IL2CPP Client + Mono Server | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ |
    | IL2CPP Server + Mono Client | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ |
    | All IL2CPP | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ |
    | All Mono | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ |

!!! warning "Code Stripping for Client Security"
    Always use conditional compilation to remove sensitive code from client builds:

    ```csharp
    #if OMNI_SERVER
        // Server-only sensitive code here
        private void ProcessSecureData() {
            // This code will be stripped from client builds
        }
    #endif
    ```

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical for Mono Clients**: 

    - Mono builds have higher exposure to decompilation
    - Code stripping is *essential* when using Mono client runtime
    - Use `#if OMNI_SERVER` for:
        - Database credentials
        - Security algorithms
        - Server-side validation logic
        - Administrative functions

Before building for deployment:

1. Switch to Release mode in Unity:

    - Go to the Unity Navigation Bar
    - Select `Omni Networking` and click `Change to Release`

2. Build your project:

    - Go to `File -> Build Settings`
    - Select your target platform
    - Click `Build` to create the executable

!!! danger "Build Mode Reset Warning"
    The build configuration will reset to DEBUG when:
    
    - Switching to new target platforms
    - Updating Omni version
    - Switching Unity version
    
    This happens because each platform/version has unique preprocessor directives (#if).

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Always verify Release mode after:**

    - Platform changes
    - Package updates
    - Unity version changes
    
    To verify/fix:

    1. Open `Omni Networking -> Change to Release`
    2. Verify build settings are correct

```
#### Setup Ubuntu Server

After deploying your VPS, follow these steps to set up your Ubuntu server for hosting your multiplayer game:

1. **Connect to Server via SSH**:

    Open a terminal and use the following command to connect to your server:

    ```bash
    ssh -i your-key.pem user@server-ip

    # Example
    ssh -i "C:\Users\user\Downloads\my-key.pem" admin@192.168.0.1
    ```

    Maybe on your first connection, you may need to configure the root password.

2. **Update your Server**:

    Run the following commands to update your server:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install unzip -y
    ```

3. **Database Setup (Optional)**:

    If your game requires a database, install MySQL/MariaDB or other database systems:

    ```bash
    # Install MySQL
    sudo apt install mysql-server -y

    # Secure MySQL installation
    sudo mysql_secure_installation

    # Start MySQL service
    sudo systemctl start mysql
    sudo systemctl enable mysql
    ```

    If you prefer MariaDB:

    ```bash
    # Install MariaDB
    sudo apt install mariadb-server -y
    
    # Secure MariaDB installation
    sudo mysql_secure_installation

    # Start MariaDB service
    sudo systemctl start mariadb
    sydo systemctl enable mariadb
    ```

    !!! warning "Database Security"
        - Use strong passwords (16+ characters)
        - Only allow local connections by default
        - Regularly backup your database:

        **Backup Your Database**:

        ```bash
        # Access MySQL/MariaDB
        sudo mysql -u root -p

        # Backup your database
        mysqldump -u root -p my_database > backup.sql

        # Restore your database
        mysql -u root -p my_database < backup.sql
        ```
