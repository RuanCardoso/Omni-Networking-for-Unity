# OmniNet - A Unity Framework for Multiplayer Game Development

OmniNet is a Unity framework created with a strong focus on achieving high-performance in the development of multiplayer games.

**Requirements**: OmniNet requires Unity version 2021.3 or later. This dependency arises from Unity's integration of .NET Standard 2.1, which enhances Network Socket capabilities and introduces valuable features such as Span, Memory, ArrayPool, and more. I decided to leverage these new features to create a high-performance networking framework.
