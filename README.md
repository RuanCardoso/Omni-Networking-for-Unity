# Omni - A Unity Framework for Multiplayer Game Development

Omni is a Unity framework created with a strong focus on achieving high-performance in the development of multiplayer games.

**Requirements**: Omni requires Unity version <b>2021.2 or later</b>. This dependency arises from Unity's integration of .NET Standard 2.1, which enhances Network Socket capabilities and introduces valuable features such as Span, Memory, ArrayPool, and more. I decided to leverage these new features to create a high-performance networking framework.
